                         # Default: ~/.ktct.yml  

bf Sub-commands:  

  ktct bf de_decrypt <DIGITAL_ENVELOP> [DATA]  # Decrypt data using specified digital envelop, DATA can also be read from STDIN. Both encrypted and unencrypted digital envelop are supported.  
  ktct bf de_encrypt <DIGITAL_ENVELOP> [DATA]  # Encrypt data using specified digital envelop, DATA can also be read from STDIN  
  ktct bf de_gen                               # Generate a random digital envelop  
  ktct bf decrypt [DATA]                       # Decrypt data using client's private key, DATA can also be read from STDIN. This command should be used for decrypting digital envelop in protocol payment API.  
  ktct bf decrypt_de <DIGITAL_ENVELOP>         # Decrypt encrypted digital envelop using client's private key  
  ktct bf encrypt [DATA]                       # Encrypt data using Baofu's public key, DATA can also be read from STDIN. This command should be used for encrypting digital envelop in protocol payment API.

  ktct bf sdecrypt [DATA]                      # Decrypt data using Baofu's public key, DATA can also be read from STDIN. This command should be used for decrypting data content in batch payment API.  
  ktct bf sencrypt [DATA]                      # Encrypt data using client's private key, DATA can also be read from STDIN. This command should be used for encrypting data content in batch payment API.  
  ktct bf ssign [DATA]                         # Sign data using client's private key, DATA can also be read from STDIN. This command should be used for signning params in protocol payment API.  
  ktct bf sverify <SIGNATURE> [DATA]           # Verify signature using Baofu's public key, DATA can also be read from STDIN. This command should be used for verifying params signature in protocol payment ..  

wjs Sub-commands:  

  ktct wjs decrypt [DATA]             # Decrypt data using client's private key, DATA can also be read from STDIN  
  ktct wjs encrypt [DATA]             # Encrypt data using Wangjinshe's public key, DATA can also be read from STDIN  
  ktct wjs help [COMMAND]             # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand  
  ktct wjs sign [DATA]                # Sign data using client's private key, DATA can also be read from STDIN  
```

## Config file Example

```
default_env: demo
demo:
  bf:
    payee-private-key-path: /my/demo/keys/client.pfx
    payee-private-key-passphrase: "12345678"
    platform-certificate-path: /my/demo/keys/server.cer
  wjs:
    server_public_key_path: /my/demo/keys/client.pkcs8
    client_private_key_path: /my/demo/keys/server.pkcs8

pro:
  bf:
    payee-private-key-path: /my/pro/keys/client.pfx
    payee-private-key-passphrase: "12345678"
    platform-certificate-path: /my/pro/keys/server.cer
  wjs:
    server_public_key_path: /my/pro/keys/client.pkcs8
    client_private_key_path: /my/pro/keys/server.pkcs8
```

Selected config environment could be specified via the `KTCT_ENV` environment variable.
If no `KTCT_ENV` specified, the value of `default_env` option in config yaml would be used.
